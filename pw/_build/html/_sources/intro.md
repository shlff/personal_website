Let me briefly introduce myself: 

I am an Economic PhD candidate and a university tutor (see [this page](teaching)), based at [the Australian National University](https://cbe.anu.edu.au/about/staff-directory/shu-hu). My chair supervisor is Professor [John Stachurski](https://johnstachurski.net/), and [Feodr Iskhakov](https://fedor.iskh.me/) and [Timothy Kam](https://phantomachine.github.io/) are in my supervisional panel. 

Also I am a researcher at [QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org/), collaborating with Professor John Stachurski, Professor [Tom Sargent](http://www.tomsargent.com/), Dr. [Matthew Mckay](https://github.com/mmcky), Mr. [Aakash Gupta](https://github.com/AakashGfude), Professor [Daisuke Oyama](http://www.oyama.e.u-tokyo.ac.jp/),  and many others on various projects (see [this page](qeprojects)).

Deeply influenced by my paternal grandfather earlier and then my supervisors, on the one hand, in addition to economics, I love mathematics and computer science (see [this page](learning)). On the other hand, I enjoy writing, reading history, doing sports, cooking and visiting nature, as well as [fine art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_art) (see [this page](miscellaneous)).
