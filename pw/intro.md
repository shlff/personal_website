Let me briefly introduce myself: 

I am an Economic PhD candidate and university tutor, [based at the Australian National University](https://cbe.anu.edu.au/about/staff-directory/shu-hu), and my chair supervisor is Professor [John Stachurski](https://johnstachurski.net/). I am also a junior researcher at [QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org/), collaborating with Professor John Stachurski, Professor [Tom Sargent](http://www.tomsargent.com/), [Dr. Matthew Mckay](https://github.com/mmcky), [Mr. Aakash Gupta](https://github.com/AakashGfude),  and many others on various projects.

Deeply influenced by my paternal grandfather and my supervisor I love mathematics, history, sports and nature, as well as [fine art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_art).
