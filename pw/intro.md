Let me briefly introduce myself: 

I am an Economics PhD student and a university tutor (see my [teaching](teaching)) 
based at [the Australian National University](https://cbe.anu.edu.au/about/staff-directory/shu-hu). 
My chair supervisor is [John Stachurski](https://johnstachurski.net/), and 
my supervision panel includes [Feodr Iskhakov](https://fedor.iskh.me/) and 
[Timothy Kam](https://phantomachine.github.io/). Also I am a researcher at [QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org/), 
collaborating closely with John Stachurski, [Tom Sargent](http://www.tomsargent.com/),
[Matthew Mckay](https://github.com/mmcky), [Jingni Yang](https://sites.google.com/site/jingniyangorange/home), 
[Aakash Gupta](https://github.com/AakashGfude), [Oyama Daisuke](http://www.oyama.e.u-tokyo.ac.jp/), 
[Humphrey Yang](https://github.com/HumphreyYang), [Smit Lunagariya](https://github.com/Smit-create) and many others on various exciting projects 
(see my [featured quantecon projects](qe)). Additionally, I am a table tennis player and coach, 
[accredited by Table Tennis Australia](https://www.revolutionise.com.au/tta/reports/accreds/certificate/&id=125&member_id=1298136&level_id=307).

Deeply influenced by my paternal grandfather earlier and then my supervisors, 
on the one hand, I love mathematics, economics and computer science 
(see my [research](research)). On the other hand, I enjoy writing, reading history, doing sports, cooking and 
visiting nature, as well as [fine art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_art) 
(see my [miscellaneousness](misc)).
